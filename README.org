# mmap tutorial
We've been doing manual block handling with explicit read,encrypt,write so we can work with files larger than system memory.

Could mmap be a better way?

# what crate?
A quick search turned up [[https://github.com/RazrFalcon/memmap2-rs][memmap2]], let's try that one?

# what do we need?
OS support
- [X] linux
- [X] mac
- [X] windows
all three are tested in memmap2 github actions
